# Movie Management System

## Overview

The Movie Management System is a secure and user-friendly platform built with Node.js. It allows users to log in, manage movies, and rate them. The system includes robust authentication, a dynamic rating mechanism, and an admin dashboard for managing reports. Users can create, update, and rate movies, while only admins have access to reported movie management.

## Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Secure login using either:
  - Username and Password
  - Email and Password
- Core functionalities are restricted for unauthenticated users.
- Ensures user data security and privacy.

### 2. **Movie Management**
- Users can:
  - View all movies.
  - View detailed information for each movie, including:
    - Description
    - Release Date
    - Duration
    - Genre
    - Created By
    - Average Rating
    - Total Ratings
    - Language
  - Create new movies (automatically linked to the creator).
  - Update their own movies.
- Updates do not alter the `updated_at` field unless metadata changes.

### 3. **Rating System**
- Users can rate movies on a scale of 1â€“5.
- Ratings are adjustable by the user.
- Each movie displays:
  - Average rating (calculated dynamically).
  - Total number of ratings.
- Updates to `avg_rating` do not affect the `updated_at` field.

### 4. **Admin Controls**
- Admins can:
  - View and manage reported movies.
  - Resolve user-submitted reports.

3. **Movie Creation and Updates**:
